# Mobile Development Path

We will develop modern and visually appealing apps using Kotlin programming and integrating the Jetpack Compose, Room, Retrofit2, CameraX, Material Design, and MPAndroidChart libraries. We implement a clean code architecture, connect applications to the API, and apply third-party services. Our application design follows the features designed based on existing problems and user needs using Figma.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech stack & Open-source libraries
<!-- Test -->
- Minimum SDK level 21
- Architecture
MVVM Architecture (View - ViewModel - Model)
Repository Pattern
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit): Construct the REST APIs and paging network data.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide): Loading images from network.
- [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/android?hl=id): TensorFlow Lite is an open source deep learning framework for on-device inference.
- [Jetpact Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose?gclid=CjwKCAjwkLCkBhA9EiwAka9QRoDjsHwvjkPI1IqNOZk6H4kdF3VYhhhCG0pKZXUIxHW3jD3W2eDuHBoClgIQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
-  [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) : Store data in the local database using Room
-  [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax?hl=id) : CameraX is a Jetpack library, built to ease the development of camera apps.
-  [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) : Material Design is to provide consistent and intuitive design guidelines for application development.
-  [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) : MPAndroidChart is a library developed by Philipp Jahoda, which is used to create interactive charts in Android apps.
-  [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines?hl=id) : Coroutine is a concurrent design pattern that you can use in Android to simplify asynchronously executed code.
-  [Datastore](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences) : DataStore is a modern data storage solution that you should use instead of SharedPreferences

## üí° Design with Figma
<!-- Test -->
- [Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/5gnRl5pdbAD3HzFzi132ps/TemanSawit-%7C-Bangkit-Capstone?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=WKjh8UlYX8DIFvlz-1)
- [Mobile Design](https://www.figma.com/file/5gnRl5pdbAD3HzFzi132ps/TemanSawit-%7C-Bangkit-Capstone?type=design&node-id=2%3A430&t=WKjh8UlYX8DIFvlz-1)

## üí° Features
<!-- Test -->
TemanSawit has three main features:
- Detection of palm fruit maturity in real time
This feature serves to help farmers detect the level of maturity of palm fruit and is expected to increase the effectiveness of fruit maturity which affects the quality of palm oil produced.
- Gender detection of oil palm seedlings
This feature helps farmers distinguish between male and female seedlings by identifying the location of tendrils on the leaves of oil palms that indicate the gender of oil palm seedlings.
- Income and outcome recording system
This feature serves to assist farmers in recording every income and outcome so that farmers are easier to organize their income.
